<h1>Inception</h1>
<p>This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You have to use docker-compose. Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service. Each service has to run in a dedicated container. For performance matters, the containers must be built either from the penultimate stable version of Alpine Linux, or from Debian Buster. The choice is yours. The Dockerfiles must be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile. You have to build yourself the Docker images of your project. This subject is a System Administration related exercise.</p>
